    My name is Eitan Shasha. I was born in 1978 in Tel Aviv, Israel. I’m married and a father of three wonderful kids. <br>
I have loved photography since I was very young. In my photos I try to reflect the world through a unique perspective of which I capture a particular moment.
Education- I have a B.sc degree in computer science and MBA degree in business management.However, my true love is photography. <br>
A decade ago I made a decision to go further with my passion for photography. I had professional training, gained experience and I can say that I turned Confucius’ famous saying “ one picture is worth one thousand words” into reality. I have the ability to perpetuate the moment and to include so many details in one accurate image. I make no compromises about the frame . I take the time to observe and pay careful attention and then take the picture at the right moment and produce an amazing image. This is great satisfaction.
Today I mainly take photos of views. I believe a picture is a supplementary product to one’s dwelling or office. A picture generates interest, pleasant atmosphere, warmth and relaxation.
You are invited to take a tour in my photo gallery in my website or Instagram and choose an image you would like to be printed in various options. I would be delighted to share my love of photography with you. <br>
I would be happy if you send me your ideas to my new photo collection. Moreover, currently I am planning my first photo exhibition.
I will be happy to keep in touch with you.
Eitan
